# Algorithm-Design-Analysis
This project analyzes various design techniques for three cryptographic algorithms: RSA, DES, and AES. It also explores the modified approaches for RSA such as Dynamic Approach using Subset Sum Cryptography and MRSA based on Random Prime Numbers; block cipher techniques for DES; and block cipher and further optimized techniques.
